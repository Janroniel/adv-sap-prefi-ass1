## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- *Service Oriented Architecture is a software architecture employing modular services for business tasks, somehow encouraging autonomy, also reusability, and collaboration of the entire system*
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-  *_Standardized Service Contracts:_  Express their purpose and capabilities, and show or use formality to standardized their service contracts*
-  *_ Loose Coupling: _ Minimize dependencies on each other to create a relationship outside the bounderies between service contract, impleme
-  *_Abstraction: _  it conceals the service complexity, while only presenting the essential features, to simplify the interaction, maintenance and reusability of service.*
   *_Service Reusability_  It means specificaly to divide with an intent to maximizing reuse.* 
   *_Autonomy:_It referes to the system's ability to operate independently, with self-governance, to reduce or minimizing external dependencies.*
   *_Statelessness:_ It means the system does not retain information about the past interactions to ensure independency between request.*
   *_Discoverability_ It means for Service to remain discoverable*
   *_Composability_ converts big problems into small or little problems.*
   *_Interoperability_  It ensures compatibility, and colllaborations when it comes to exchanging and using of information, which should be common or standard for the subscribers to use the service.*
3. Define Microservices.
- *It is an architectural paradigm where an application is built as a set of small independent services, while both runs unique functions that allows code to be updated more easily.*
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- ***Independently Deployable*** *, because it allows changes without affecting the entire application.*
-  ***Right tool for the job*** *, because it consider the unique requirement in order to have the best outcome.*
-  ***Precise scaling*** *, service can be individually deployed, while resulting to make the job done.*
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-   ***Similarities***
   *- they both emphhasize service-based architecture, which is loose coupling, scalability, modularity, and reusability.*
-   ***Difference***
   *- SOA is more larger, and flexible technology stack, while _Microservice_ are smaller, and use diverse technology.*
